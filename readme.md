Before running the application - Spoiler Warning:
The Application will not function due to UWP and the accompanying portable library's inability to read or write to files.
A system.unauthorizedaccessexception exception will present it self if the register button is pressed.
As this is my second attempt after falling to connect the ASP front with a class library in my first attempt despite countless hours of trying. 
And again after spending countless hours trying to convert the already constructed .net core 2.0 class library into the porteble class library used 
by the UWP front only to hit roadblock after roadblock, Iam now throwing in the towel with the inability to read and write to files.
It is my conclusion that I have been trying to fit a square peg into a round hole and no amount of whittling will make it fit.
